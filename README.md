# Crude-Oil-Price-Prediction

### Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA) is used to predict the crude oil price.

#### Two dataset files were used for both exogenous and endogenous parameters.The model was trained with order of (1,1,1). This model is then used to predict the value from a range of dates. 

*Mean Absolute Error: 1.32*

*Prediction Accuracy: 98.55%*

##### The model was able to predict the value with greater accuracy.

##### The model considered more factors for the final prediction.
